## Parent Frontend Design Guidelines from the.STYLIST.md

### Overall Aesthetic:
*   **Balance:** Professional, clean, and organized for parents, with playful, encouraging, and visually rich elements for children.
*   **Theme:** A friendly, educational, and supportive environment. Avoid overly childish or overly corporate looks.

### Color Palette & Typography:
*   **Primary Palette (Parent-facing):** Soft, calming colors (e.g., muted blues, greens, grays) for background and structural elements. Accent colors (e.g., a brighter teal, orange, or purple) for calls to action and important information.
*   **Secondary Palette (Child-facing/Interactive):** Brighter, more vibrant colors for interactive elements, flashcards, and positive feedback. Ensure high contrast for readability.
*   **Typography:**
    *   **Headings:** A clear, legible sans-serif font (e.g., Lato, Open Sans, Montserrat) for strong hierarchy.
    *   **Body Text:** A highly readable sans-serif font with good line height and letter spacing.
    *   **Child-facing:** Consider a slightly larger font size and a font that is easy for early readers to decipher.

### Layout & Navigation:
*   **Parent Dashboard:**
    *   **Student Selector:** A prominent, easy-to-use student switcher (e.g., dropdown, horizontal scrollable list of student avatars/names) at the top or in a sidebar.
    *   **Student Cards/Overview:** Each student should have a clear, concise card displaying key information (e.g., name, current progress summary, quick links to their profile/flashcards).
    *   **Navigation:** A clear, consistent navigation menu (sidebar or top bar) with links to:
        *   Dashboard (overview of all students)
        *   Individual Student Profiles
        *   Progress Reports
        *   Account Settings
        *   Add/Claim Student
*   **Student Profile Page:** Dedicated page for each student with detailed progress, assigned words, and options for parents to manage their learning (e.g., assign new words, review notes).
*   **Responsive Design:** Essential for use on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### Child Interaction Elements (e.g., Flashcards):
*   **Visual Focus:** Large, clear images/illustrations for words. Minimal text where possible.
*   **Simplicity:** Clean interface, minimal distractions. Focus on the word/image and interaction.
*   **Feedback:** Immediate, positive visual and auditory feedback for correct answers. Gentle, constructive feedback for incorrect answers.
*   **Large Touch Targets:** Buttons and interactive areas should be large and easy for small fingers to tap.
*   **Progress Indicators:** Simple, visual progress bars or indicators to show how far along a child is in a session.

### Accessibility:
*   **Color Contrast:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for all text and interactive elements.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable and operable via keyboard.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.
*   **Font Sizing:** Allow for text resizing without loss of content or functionality.
*   **Clear Language:** Use simple, direct language, especially for child-facing elements.

### Key UX Principles:
1.  **Clarity & Simplicity:** Easy to understand and use for both parents and children.
2.  **Consistency:** Predictable navigation and interaction patterns across the application.
3.  **Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear feedback for all user actions.
4.  **Empowerment:** Give parents control over their children's learning journey, and children a sense of accomplishment.
5.  **Engagement:** Make learning enjoyable and motivating for children, and the management process efficient for parents.
