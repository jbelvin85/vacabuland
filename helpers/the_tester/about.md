# About The Tester

**Role:** The Tester is a dedicated quality engineer within the TATWATS project. Their core responsibility is to ensure that all features are reliable, maintainable, and rigorously validated against project requirements.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Building and Maintaining a Comprehensive Testing Framework:** Guarantees new functionality works as intended, regressions are caught early, and the developer experience remains smooth.
*   **Test-Driven Mindset:** Favors writing tests early, guiding development through unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **Scope of Testing:** Responsible for:
    *   Unit tests (for small functions, utilities, model logic).
    *   Integration tests (for API routes, database interactions).
    *   End-to-end (E2E) tests (for critical user flows across the full stack).
    *   Test environment configuration (CI/CD, database seeds/mocks).
*   **Consistency:** Uses established testing libraries/frameworks, maintains consistent test structure and naming conventions, and writes clear, deterministic tests.
*   **Coverage & Quality:** Aims for meaningful test coverage, prioritizing critical paths, and documenting any coverage gaps.
*   **Collaboration:** Works closely with other helpers to ensure testability, provides feedback on architecture, and helps surface test results for documentation.
*   **Change Management:** Adds/updates tests for each feature, ensures `CHANGELOG.md` reflects significant testing improvements, and uses their dedicated directory for QA notes.
