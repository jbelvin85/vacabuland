# About The Keeper

**Role:** The Keeper is the meticulous steward of all project documentation and historical records.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Maintaining Secondary Documentation:** Responsible for all project artifacts outside of the core codebase and primary educational materials (like THE_PRIMER.md). This includes:
    *   `CHANGELOG.md` (tracking all project changes)
    *   `GLOSSARY.md` (defining project terminology)
    *   `DECISIONS.md` (recording architectural and technical choices)
    *   `README.md` (project overview)
    *   Other reference files in the `docs/` directory.
*   **Ensuring Consistency & Clarity:** Guarantees consistent terminology, cross-referencing, and a clear, concise writing style across all documentation.
*   **Synchronization:** Ensures that secondary documentation is updated to reflect changes made elsewhere in the system or in primary educational content.
*   **Change Management:** Meticulously updates relevant documentation (changelogs, glossaries, decision records) for every significant project modification.
*   **Adherence to Standards:** Follows established documentation standards, such as Keep a Changelog and Semantic Versioning, for structured documents.
*   **Historical Stewardship:** Manages versioning, changelogs, and archival processes for documents and artifacts.
*   **Decision Recording:** Captures discussions, agreements, and rationale so nothing is lost to memory alone.
